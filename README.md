# TheHeisenbergClub

**The Heisenberg Club** is a closed-source Python workspace for building and evaluating **low-latency forecasting systems**.

*A modular platform for time‑series forecasting, built for reproducibility and traceability.*

## Audience

This project is intended for researchers, engineers, data scientists, and technically inclined readers who want to understand forecasting platforms at a conceptual level.


## Project Overview

Heisenberg can be understood as a platform built from several tightly interrelated modules, each of which plays a distinct role in the overall life cycle of forecasting. At the foundation lie the processes of **data acquisition, cleanup, and precomputed caching**. These steps ensure that disparate time‑series feeds are transformed into aligned and validated datasets that can be retrieved efficiently and without ambiguity. On top of this prepared data, the **training module** provides a disciplined environment for developing and validating models, and for freezing artifacts that can later be deployed with confidence in their provenance.

When models are ready to be exercised in practice, the **heisenberg‑runtime** service acts as the operational gateway. It is designed as a standalone process that can load trained artifacts and serve forecasts to downstream applications through a simple API. To measure how well these forecasts perform, the **heisenberg‑eval** component offers a reproducible evaluation framework, enabling rigorous testing against baselines and benchmarks. Complementing this, the **heisenberg‑backtest** environment allows historical replay and simulation so that decision logic can be stress‑tested against real market scenarios.

Together these modules embody a philosophy that balances theoretical soundness with practical utility. The emphasis is on **low‑latency runtime performance**, **reproducible evaluation methods**, and **transparent logging and traceability**. The development practices are reinforced by strict typing, continuous integration, and testing discipline. Finally, the entire trajectory of the platform is conceived with an eye toward future deployment and external integration, so that what begins as an experimental system can mature into a reliable operational tool.
